Goal of this project is to design and build waterproof, daylight visible, intelligent (IoT), bike tail light for road rides. I got fed up with various tail light 
products which easily break, drain battery too fast, or leak and stop working after few rainy rides, despite being advertised as waterproof, so i decided to 
design my own. 

This is also a followup/improvement of first BLS project where i have embedded Bluetooth in Cateye lamps (this one is entirely from scratch).
