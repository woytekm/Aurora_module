Another use case of Aurora - bluetooth enabled torch wich can be used as bicycle front light (along with BLS2-rear) or as a head lamp (depending on mount bracket used). 
This torch is using Cree T6 LED, and can work up to 14 hours in maximum light mode.

Same as rear light - device is water resistant and has 2500 mah of battery life.

This version has MPR121 based touch sensor with three acive pads for interaction.
