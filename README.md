Repository for Aurora module project - nRF52840 based mobile platform

Aurora is an SBC dedicated to various lighting related projects (bike lights, head torches, ambient lighting,etc...). It is equipped with on board 2500 mAh 16650 recharegable battery, nRF 52840 SOC, and optional peripherals: GPS module, accelerometer, barometer/thermometer sensors, additional onboard flash memory, USB, and 12 GPIO's for steering external light sources. 

Initially i was going to design and build nRF52840 module dedicated for https://github.com/woytekm/Project_NAO , but finally i decided to design more universal module, which could be used for many different lighting related projects.
